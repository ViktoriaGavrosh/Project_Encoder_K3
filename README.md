# Project_Encoder_K3
This project created during the learning process

That program can encrypt or decrypt text using
 only zeros and spaces.

☝️ The program looped to terminate only if 
the user inputs "exit" ☝️

The program asks the user for the desired 
option (encode/decode/exit), performs it, 
and all that in a loop until the user wants 
to finish:
- It ask users what they want to do, encode 
a string, decode a string or quit the program 
- If user inputs "encode", the program prints 
Input string: "to the output", reads a line 
and outputs two lines — "Encoded string:" 
followed by the encoded string;
- If user inputs "decode", the program prints 
"Input encoded string:" to the output, reads 
a line and outputs two lines — "Decoded 
string:" followed by the actual decoded string;
- If user inputs "exit", the program says 
Bye! and finishs execution.
- The program looped to terminate only if 
the user inputs "exit"
